Hello, my name is Manny.

I like coding, astronomy, and music.

I have a B.S. in Physics, and a B.S. in Astrophysics, both of which were obtained from the College of Charleston in Charleston, SC, USA.
I am expected to receive an M.S. in Astronomy from New Mexico State University, Las Cruces, NM, USA. I expect to receive this degree by the end of Summer 2022.

While I love space and learning about the universe we live in, I have become very interested in joining industry as a full stack developer.

I am extremely knowledgable in Python and can build Graphical User Interface's (GUIs), webscrapers, websites and web apps, and RESTful API's. I am also fully capable of working with SQL and NoSQL Databases, performing data analysis and building data visualization tools.

Furthermore, I am very familiar with front-end languages such as HTML, CSS5, and JavaScript, as well as back-end tools like Node.JS, Express, Django and Flask. 

I am about a month short from finishing a course in React.JS, which I hope will increase my employeability.


I also like music, exercising, and travelling!
