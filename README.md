# Hello there 👋🏽


## Welcome to Manny's GitHub profile

I like coding 👨🏽‍💻, astronomy 🔭, music 🎧 and working out 🏋🏽.

I have a B.S. in Physics, and a B.S. in Astrophysics, both of which were obtained from the College of Charleston in Charleston, SC, USA 🏖.
I am currently a master's student at New Mexico State University, Las Cruces, NM, USA 🌵. I expect to receive this degree by the Winter of 2022.

While I love space and learning about the universe we live in, I have become very interested in joining industry as a full stack developer once I complete the Master's program at NMSU.

I am extremely knowledgable in Python thanks to my own research as an astrophysicist, as well as Python Bootcamp that I took on Udemy. With Python, I can build Graphical User Interface's (GUIs), webscrapers, websites/web applications (Flask), and RESTful API's. I am also fully capable of working with SQL and NoSQL Databases, performing data analysis and building data visualization tools.

Furthermore, I am very familiar with front-end languages and frameworks such as HTML, CSS5, JavaScript, ReactJS and Bootstrap, as well as back-end tools like Node.JS, Express, Django and Flask. My goal is to have this github page reflect my knowledge as a full stack developer so that YOU, my potential future employer, can see that I am a worthy developer who will prove to be a great asset to your team!
