Hello 😊

My name is Manny 🙋🏽‍♂️.

I like coding 👨🏽‍💻, astronomy 🔭, and music 🎧.

I have a B.S. in Physics, and a B.S. in Astrophysics, both of which were obtained from the College of Charleston in Charleston, SC, USA 🏖.
I am currently in Grad school for Astronomy at New Mexico State University, Las Cruces, NM, USA 🌵. 
I expect to receive this degree by the end of Summer 2022.

While I love space and learning about the universe we live in, I have become very interested in joining industry as a full stack developer once I complete my Masters.

I am extremely knowledgable in Python and can build Graphical User Interface's (GUIs), webscrapers, websites and web apps, and RESTful API's. I am also fully capable of working with SQL and NoSQL Databases, performing data analysis and building data visualization tools.

Furthermore, I am very familiar with front-end languages and frameworks such as HTML, CSS5, JavaScript, ReactJS and Bootstrap, as well as back-end tools like Node.JS, Express, Django and Flask. My goal is to have this github page reflect my knowledge as a full stack developer so that YOU, my potential future employer, can see that I am a worthy developer who will prove to be a great asset to your team!
